# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The index check reads the first column of each btree index and the
  `varchar` columns of each table from the catalog once per engine for the
  whole session instead of once per test. Any statement that may change
  them (`CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `REINDEX`, `TRUNCATE` and other DDL,
  seen in tests and fixtures alike) clears the cache, as does the end of a
  transaction that ran one. On 100 tests with 10 indexed statements each
  against PostgreSQL 17, the check went from about 2.3 ms to 1.2 ms per
  statement (#5). The same statement is explained again after such DDL, so
  a rolled-back index change no longer hides a finding.

### Fixed

- The index check no longer loses its catalog lookups for the rest of the
  session when the cache is cleared while a plan is being read, for example
  from another thread or when a connection is garbage collected.
- The index check now judges temporary tables: trailing columns of their
  multicolumn indexes and `varchar` casts were silently skipped, because
  PostgreSQL names the schema `pg_temp` in plans and `pg_temp_<n>` in the
  catalog.
- A statement that cannot be planned is counted once in the "could not be
  explained" summary, also when DDL made the check try it again.
- The catalog cache is also cleared when a two-phase transaction that ran
  DDL ends.
- The index check now reports a partial index read in full as a bitmap.
  With an index such as `(id) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` and
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND email = ?`, the plan before `ANALYZE` was
  skipped, while the plan after it was reported (#4).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- Missing-index check for PostgreSQL 16 and newer, off by default. With
  `--queryguard-index-check` or `queryguard_index_check = true`, each
  distinct `SELECT` in a test body is planned with
  `EXPLAIN (GENERIC_PLAN, VERBOSE, FORMAT JSON)` and `enable_seqscan` off,
  inside a savepoint on the statement's own connection. The test fails (or
  warns, in `warn` mode) when the plan reads a whole table to apply a
  filter, walks a whole index for an equality filter, or uses an index
  condition that leaves out a btree index's first column (PostgreSQL 16
  and 17). The message names the table, the condition, the SQL and the call
  site and, when the column is obvious, gives a `CREATE INDEX` hint.
- `--no-queryguard-index-check` to turn the check off for one run.
- `queryguard_index_ignore_tables` ini option and
  `@pytest.mark.allow_missing_index` marker to exclude small lookup tables
  or whole tests from the index check.
- A session summary for statements the index check could not check:
  other databases, PostgreSQL before 16, async engines, statements
  PostgreSQL could not plan, and a check stopped by a broken savepoint.
- CI job that runs the test suite against PostgreSQL 15, 16 and 17.

### Changed

- `IN` lists whose placeholders carry multi-word, schema-qualified or
  quoted type casts (`$1::DOUBLE PRECISION`, `$1::public.mood`) or use
  `CAST(? AS INTEGER)` now collapse to one form for N+1 detection.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

First release.

### Added

- Automatic N+1 detection for SQLAlchemy 2 in every test, with no
  configuration. Two rules: one relationship lazy-loaded for several parent
  objects, and one normalized `SELECT` repeated several times.
- Failure messages that point to the line of application code that caused
  the N+1, show the SQL involved and, for relationship loads, suggest a
  `selectinload` fix.
- `@pytest.mark.max_queries(n)` marker (also `max_queries(n=...)`) that fails
  a test running more than `n` SQL statements and lists every statement with
  its call site.
- `pytest_queryguard.max_queries()` context manager, which raises
  `QueryBudgetExceeded` and also works outside pytest.
- `@pytest.mark.allow_nplusone` marker to skip N+1 detection for one test.
- Ini options `queryguard_mode` (`fail`, `warn`, `off`),
  `queryguard_relationship_threshold` and `queryguard_repeat_threshold`,
  readable from `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg` and
  pytest 9's native `[tool.pytest]` table.
- `--queryguard-mode` command-line option that overrides the ini value.
- `--queryguard-report` command-line option that prints the ten tests with
  the most queries at the end of the session.
- Support for `AsyncSession`, FastAPI's `TestClient` and code that queries
  from other threads.
- Only the test function body is measured; fixture setup and teardown are not.
- An internal error disables the plugin with a single warning instead of
  failing the test suite.
